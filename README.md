# DiseasePredictionviaGCN

This project implements a disease prediction model using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). By representing medical data as a graph structure, the model captures complex relationships between symptoms and diseases to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Features

- **Graph-Based Modeling**: Utilizes GCNs to model the intricate relationships in medical data.
- **Sample Dataset**: Includes sample data for testing and demonstration purposes.
- **Modular Codebase**: Structured code for easy understanding and extension.

## Repository Structure


```bash

└── README.md              # Project documentation
```


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sgupta873/DiseasePredictionviaGCN.git
   cd DiseasePredictionviaGCN
   ```


2. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


   *Note: Ensure that `requirements.txt` is present in the repository. If not, manually install the prerequisites mentioned above.*

## Usage

To run the disease prediction model:


```bash
python master.py
```


This script will process the sample data and output the prediction results.

## Data Format

The sample data should be structured appropriately to represent the graph, including nodes for symptoms and diseases, and edges representing their relationships.
